# Portfolio1

My first portfolio project with Codecademy!  (I am still new and apriciate any mistakes being pointed out!)

This project was for practise / part of my studies.  

I have used HTML, CSS and a couple of lines of JavaScript which targets the HTML on the 'contact' page.

You can navigate the site through the links in the header and footer and play the videos on the main page.

You can click the 'Contact Me' header on the contact page and the background will turn orange.
